# Virtual Painting App
The Virtual Painting app is a Python project that allows you to draw paintings virtually by tracking hand and finger gestures using your camera.

#Prerequisites
Before running the Virtual Painting app, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (version 3.6 or above)
OpenCV (version 4.0 or above)
Numpy
Pygame
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Create a new Python virtual environment (optional but recommended).

Activate the virtual environment (if created).

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install opencv-python numpy pygame
Usage
Connect a camera to your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Activate the virtual environment (if created).

Run the following command to start the Virtual Painting app:


python virtual_painting.py
The app will open a window displaying the camera feed. Place your hand in front of the camera, making sure it's well-lit and visible.

Use your fingers to draw on the screen. The app will track your hand movements and create virtual paintings based on your gestures.
